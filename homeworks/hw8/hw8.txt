(a) see test.net
(b) To make Pr(D|T) >= 0.30, we can constrain one of the following:
 - the prior of having the disease >= 0.8942%
 - the false positive rate <= 0.2219%
And changing false negative rate cannot achieve Pr(D|T) >= 0.30

2.
(a) set of variables and values:
  ExpectingGuests,    yes/no
  FamilyHome,         yes/no
  SoundSensor,        on/off
  LightSensor,        on/off
  HearableBarking,    yes/no
  Battery,            ok/dead
  SoundSensorHealth,  ok/broken
  LightSensorHealth,  ok/broken
  DogBarking,         yes/no
  DogOutside,         yes/no
  OutdoorLight,       on/off
  DogBowelTrouble,    yes/no

(b) causal structure looks like the following:
ExpectingGuests                                     LightSensorHealth
     |                                                       |
     |-----> OutdoorLight --------------------------------------> LightSensor
     |                                                       |
FamilyHome                                                Battery
     |                                                       |
     |-----> DogOutside --> DogBarking -- >HearableBarking ----> SoundSensor
     |                                                       |
DogBowelTrouble                                      SoundSensorHealth

(c) learnt results available in sambot.net (using the network in (b), learning (with 
default parameters and uniform parameters for initial network) using given sambot.dat)

Answers: 
(1) the most likely instantiation of all variables given that Sambot has sensed the 
lights to be on, but has sensed no bark.

Most likely instantiation:
  ExpectingGuests,    no
  FamilyHome,         no
  HearableBarking,    no
  Battery,            ok
  SoundSensorHealth,  ok
  LightSensorHealth,  ok
  DogBarking,         no
  DogOutside,         yes
  OutdoorLight,       on
  DogBowelTrouble,    yes

After constructing the network and learning using given .dat file (default parameters), 
this conclusion is reached by setting LightSensor = On, SoundSensor = Off and reporting
the value with higher probability as shown in SamIam monitor.

(2) the most likely instantiation of the sensors given that the family is home and 
no guests are expected.

Most likely instantiation:
  SoundSensor,        off
  LightSensor,        off
  HearableBarking,    no
  Battery,            ok
  SoundSensorHealth,  ok
  LightSensorHealth,  ok
  DogBarking,         yes
  DogOutside,         yes
  OutdoorLight,       off
  DogBowelTrouble,    yes

This conclusion is reached by setting ExpectingGuests = No, FamilyHome = Yes

(3) Z = {Battery, FamilyHome} would be a smallest set such that given Z SoundSensor
and LightSensor are independent.
There are two paths from SoundSensor to LightSensor, Battery is the only node 
on a divergent path, thus Battery need to be in Z.
All nodes on the other path are either sequential or divergent, thus putting one
among FamilyHome, OutdoorLight, DogOutside, DogBarking or HearableBarking into Z
would block this path.

(4) The network is a multiply-connected.
