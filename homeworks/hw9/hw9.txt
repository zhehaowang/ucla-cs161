After changing the number of iterations to 10, the accuracy is around 78%.
After changing the number of iterations to 10000, the accuracy is around 92%.
Changing to 10 greatly reduces the accuracy, since we are under utilizing the training set we are given (using at most 1000 of the 55000 entries in our training set).
Changing to 10000 doesn't help much with accuracy, since the previous number of iterations already has a reasonable coverage of the training set.
